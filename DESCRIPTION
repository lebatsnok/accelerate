Description: Analyzing accelerometer 'counts' data. The package includes all common steps in 
    accelerometer data analysis: (1) reading in data files, (2) preprocessing, e.g., using
    non-wear detection algorithms, (3) summarizing by arbitrary time units, and (4) summarizing
    at the level of the individual. There are functions for plotting, converting the data into
    time series (using the package 'zoo'), and batch processing. There are currently functions for reading in data files from
    'Actigraph' <https://www.actigraphcorp.com/> and '3DNX' <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21483427> devices,
    in various text-based formats as well as the ActiGraph '.agd' files.
